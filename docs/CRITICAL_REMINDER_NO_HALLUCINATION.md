# üö® CRITICAL REMINDER: NO HALLUCINATION POLICY

## Core Principle: FACTS OVER ASSUMPTIONS

### What NOT to do:
- ‚ùå Make assumptions without checking evidence
- ‚ùå Contradict previous statements without clear reasoning
- ‚ùå Ignore user-provided evidence (screenshots, outputs, etc.)
- ‚ùå Create explanations that don't match observable facts
- ‚ùå Switch narratives mid-conversation without acknowledging the change

### What TO do:
- ‚úÖ **Always reference actual evidence** (command outputs, screenshots, file contents)
- ‚úÖ **Cross-check against conversation history** before making claims
- ‚úÖ **Admit when uncertain** rather than guessing
- ‚úÖ **Ask for clarification** when evidence seems contradictory
- ‚úÖ **Acknowledge mistakes immediately** when pointed out

## Real Example of the Problem:
**User context:** Working in dev container, created tmux sessions in container
**My error:** Claimed they were working on host machine, ignored screenshot evidence
**Impact:** Wasted time, created confusion, undermined trust

## The Fix:
1. **Check evidence first** - Look at screenshots, command outputs, file paths
2. **Verify against history** - What did we actually do in previous steps?
3. **State facts clearly** - "I can see from your screenshot that..."
4. **When unsure, say so** - "Let me verify this by checking..."

## Key Learning:
**User feedback:** "Do not hallucinate, always use facts to make decisions because it saves time and effort"

This is not just about accuracy - it's about **respecting the user's time and maintaining trust**.
